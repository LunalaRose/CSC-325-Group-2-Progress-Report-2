# CSC-325-Group-2-Discord-Bot

In the current state of the project, each team member has taken on a subdivison of the overall bot and begun developing commands and behaviors.
A token (currently non-working) was accidentally left in one of the files, but it's ok as a new one has been generated already and invalidated that one.
